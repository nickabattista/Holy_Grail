 Equations of Motion:
 D (Vorticity) /Dt = nu*Laplacian(Vorticity)  
 Laplacian(Psi) = - Vorticity                                                       

      Real Space Variables                   Fourier (Frequency) Space                                                          
       SteamFunction: Psi                     StreamFunction: Psi_hat
 Velocity: u = Psi_y & v = -Psi_x              Velocity: u_hat ,v_hat
         Vorticity: Vort                        Vorticity: Vort_hat


 IDEA: for each time-step
       1. Solve Poisson problem for Psi (in Fourier space)
       2. Compute nonlinear advection term by finding u and v in real
          variables by doing an inverse-FFT, compute advection, transform
          back to Fourier space
       3. Time-step vort_hat in frequency space using a semi-implicit
          Crank-Nicholson scheme (explicit for nonlinear adv. term, implicit
          for viscous term)

 TO RUN: 
       MATLAB: type <FFT_NS_Solver> into the command window
       Python3: type <run FFT_NS_Solver.py>

 VISUALIZE: 
       MATLAB/Python 3: Open .vtk data (in vtk_data folder) in either 
                        VisIt or ParaView

       NOTE: MATLAB can plot in MATLAB, as well.
